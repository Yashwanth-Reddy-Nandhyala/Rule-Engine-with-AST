# Rule-Engine-with-AST
Overview
The Rule Engine AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) project is designed to provide a robust and extensible framework for creating and managing rules within applications. This engine parses rules written in a specific syntax and compiles them into an AST for further evaluation and execution. This README provides comprehensive details about building, setting up, and running the application.

Features
Extensible Rule Definitions: Users can define custom rules using a user-friendly syntax.
Abstract Syntax Tree Representation: The engine converts rules into an AST for efficient evaluation.
Modular Architecture: The project is designed for easy extensibility and maintainability.
Docker Support: Easily deployable using Docker containers.
Dependencies
Before building the application, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

Java: Version 11 or higher
Maven: Version 3.6 or higher (for building the project)
Docker: Version 20.10 or higher (for running the application in containers)
PostgreSQL: Version 13 or higher (for the database, can be run in a Docker container)
To install Docker and PostgreSQL, you can use the following commands:


Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rule-engine-ast.git
cd rule-engine-ast
Build the project using Maven:

bash
Copy code
mvn clean install
The built JAR file will be located in the target directory.

Design Choices
Language: The project is implemented in Java for its robust type system and cross-platform capabilities.
Architecture: The application follows a modular architecture pattern, separating concerns to improve maintainability and extensibility.
AST Representation: The Abstract Syntax Tree design allows for efficient rule evaluation and easy manipulation of rule structures.
Running the Application
To run the application, follow these steps:

Ensure the PostgreSQL container is running (as described in the Dependencies section).

Start the application with the following command:

bash
Copy code
java -jar target/rule-engine-ast.jar
The application will be accessible at http://localhost:8080.

Usage
Once the application is running, you can:

Define rules using the provided syntax.
Submit rules for evaluation via the API endpoints.
Retrieve results from the evaluated rules.
Refer to the API documentation for detailed usage instructions.
